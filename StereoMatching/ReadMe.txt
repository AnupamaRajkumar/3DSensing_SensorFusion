1. Input the window size and occlusion weight on user prompt in main
2. You can choose from naive, dynamic and standard openCV stereo matching algorithms at the user prompt
3. 7 different naive stereo matching methods can be chosen
4. 3 different openCV stereo matching algorithms
5. Disparity map and point cloud generated for each methods
6. Calibration file added in the Data folder
7. Other images with corresponding calibration information can be downloaded from Middlebury dataset website (https://vision.middlebury.edu/stereo/data/scenes2014/)
8. Use of OpenMP for parallelisation
